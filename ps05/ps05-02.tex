\begin{enumerate}
\item Mark the ends of $w$ with directional end markers.
\item Scan $w$ until there is a 1. Mark it blank.\\
If at this point, $w$ is empty or does not contain 1s, accept.
\item Continue scanning until there is a 0. Mark it blank.\\
If there are no more 0s, then accept
\item Continue scanning until there is another 0. Mark it blank. \\If at this point, $w$ is empty, reject. If not repeat step 2.  
\end{enumerate}
Note that I included the directional end markers to enable the machine to scan in a zig zag pattern.
