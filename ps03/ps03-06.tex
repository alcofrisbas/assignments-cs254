	\item Proof \#1: While 
	\item Proof \#2: This proof is in error because of the definition of closure. By our definition in class, if S is closed under an operation, for $a, b \in S$, that operation($a,b$) is also in $S$. Specified here is a closed operation on TWO languages yielding a regular language, while proof 2 specifies $i$ languages, which is invalid.
	\item Proof \#3: This proof is in error because the closure rule of intersection is not bidirectional. Using closure to prove that a language is regular can only be done when the language in question is part of a closure expression and both its pair AND the resulting languages are regular. \\Ex: $B$ is proven regular in this situation: $A$ and $C$ are regular AND $A \cap B = C$.
