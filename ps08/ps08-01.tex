$T(n) := \{A : \exists \text{ a TM } M s.t. L(M) = A\ \&\ M \text{ runs in } O(n)\text{ time.}\}$
\begin{proof}
There are two aspects to this proof. Part one was proven in class. We know based on class content that any Regular language can be represented decidably by a Turing Machine.\\
Next, since a DFA only makes one transition per input character its runtime is solely dependent on the length of the input $x$(with length $n$), and linearly so. 
\end{proof}
