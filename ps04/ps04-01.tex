	\item When $i \neq 1$, the number of $b$s and $c$s is not important. However, if $i = 1$, then the DFA must output $a^nb^n$, which is not possible, as illustrated by the DFA below. The state $bad$ is where the machine must, but cannot calculate $a^nb^n$.

	\item Given $w \in F$ and $w = xyz$, if $\mid xy \mid = 1$, the $x = \varepsilon$ and $y = a$. If you were to pump $y$ any number of times, then the $w = xy^tz \in F$.
	\item The Pumping Lemma is a requirement for a language to be regular but not a guarantee. Let $P$ be a predicate meaning that language $A$ passes the pumping lemma. We know that $\neg P \Rightarrow \neg\text{regular}(A)$, but the equation is not biconditional, as proven by parts $a$ and $b$ above. $P \nRightarrow \text{regular}(A)$.
